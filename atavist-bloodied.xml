            <p>Your color of atavist is one who thrives on a wounded physique, gaining adrenaline and power from being closer to death. These atavists tend towards extreme masochism, and are sometimes only truly happy when they can feel cuts, bruises, and blood pumping from their body alarmingly.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Beginning at 3rd level when you choose this aspect, you gain two benefits as a bloodied aspect warrior, which strengthen as you become weaker, and your innate reflexes take over. Choose one of the following features, which remain active as long as you are below your maximum hitpoints:</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alacrity.</em></strong> You hover in and out of a foe’s reach, stepping between it as easily as a flick of a blade. You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Beating Reflexes.</em></strong> Your agility and bulk are unparalled. You can rend to Strength and Dexterity ability checks.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Control.</em></strong> You finely manipulate your blood. When you rend, you can reroll the rend dice once per turn and choose either result.</p>
            <p>In addition, choose one of the following features. When you fall below half your hitpoint maximum (rounded up), your chosen feature activates for you, remaining active as long as you are under that threshold:</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Serrated Strike.</em></strong> Your blade’s edge coats and sharpens in spilled blood. When you roll the maximum number on a damage die or rend die, you can add an additional 1d8 to the result. If you roll an 8 on the additional 1d8, you can add an additional 1d8 to the result, and so on.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Thickening Humors.</em></strong> Your spells are overloaded as your bones crack and disjoint under the heavy hand of atavism. You can add your Constitution modifier to the damage you deal with any atavist spell.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Unceasing Flow.</em></strong> Your blood runs like water. When you rend yourself and add the result to a weapon damage roll, the result is doubled—you both take and apply double the rend result.</p>

When your fury against death ends, you gain four levels of exhaustion.</p>
