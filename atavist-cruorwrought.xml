            <p>Atavists use their bodies in ways far beyond the normal capacity of any other creatures. Certain atavists follow their blood, gaining physical command of it—shaping and wielding it inside and outside of their bodies, as well as in the bodies of others.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Beginning at 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you can create a weapon of blood to wield. When you take the Attack action, you can rend to create a weapon of blood in either one of your hands. You can create a melee weapon you are proficient with or coat a weapon you are currently holding in blood. On a hit, the target loses hitpoints equal to the weapon’s damage dice + your rend dice + your Strength or Dexterity modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent">The blood of the weapon falls into a pool after two hits with the weapon or if it leaves your grasp.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Also at 3rd level, you can either create or destroy blood as a bonus action. To create, you make up to 10 gallons of blood within 30 feet of you in a space you can see. Alternatively, the blood falls as rain in a 30-foot sphere within range. To destroy, you destroy up to 10 gallons of blood within 30 feet of you in a space you can see. Once you destroy blood, you can only create blood once before needing to destroy it again. Additionally, you can drain one Small or larger corpse of blood within range. If you drain a corpse of blood, you can create a weapon of blood without losing any hitpoints yourself the first time you do so within the next minute.</p>
