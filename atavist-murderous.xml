            <p>Murderous atavists are honed on the hunt: they use their power to deplete and destroy others. They attack strategically weak spots in a creature, taking them down in stride. Their motivations for this are more varied than the monsters and people they kill: money, fame, altruism, addiction, blackmail, divine, profane, insanity, vengeance, thrill seeking, political gain, or any other inscrutable motivations; perhaps some don’t have or need a reason.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you choose one of the fighting styles below. You can’t choose the same fighting style more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Dueling.</em></strong> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Throwing.</em></strong> You gain a +2 bonus to ranged attack rolls you make with a thrown weapon. Whenever you make a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you can immediately draw another weapon as part of the attack.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Two-Weapon Fighting.</em></strong> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, choose two fighting maneuvers, for which you can’t choose the same again</p>
